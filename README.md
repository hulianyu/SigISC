# SigISC



### Implementation Highlight

The pivotal clustering tree from the paper "**Significance-based Interpretable Sequence Clustering**" has been implemented in Matlab (`SigISC.m`), providing **markedly faster** execution with the same results as the prior Python version (`SigISC.py`) in this repository: https://github.com/JinfengHe/SigISC

### View Results

To view the final performance results as presented in the paper, simply run `main.m` in Matlab.

### Datasets Used

File `Sequence2BinaryData` file contains 14 real-world sequential datasets that have been profiled by specific patterns. These patterns have been mined using the "Sequential Pattern Discovery under Multiple Constraints" method ([PatternMining.py](https://github.com/JinfengHe/SigISC/blob/master/PatternMining.py)).
